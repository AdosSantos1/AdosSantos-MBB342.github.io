**Markdown Text**
Posts use markdown text in '.md' files. Surround text with one star (*) for *italicized text* and two stars (**) for **bold text**.
Next you can update your site name, avatar and other options using the _config.yml file in the root of your repository (shown below).

*Adding Images*
Add your images to your repo and be sure to commit them.
To add images to a post: "![figure title(link to image)]"
